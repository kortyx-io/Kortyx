# Docs Next Steps (Adoption + DX)

This file tracks the next improvements needed to make Kortyx docs dead-simple for onboarding and reliable for advanced users.

## Priority 1 — Onboarding outcomes

1. Add a **Start Here** index page that gives role-based entry points:
   - Build a chatbot fast
   - Build custom workflow orchestration
   - Integrate a custom provider
2. Add explicit success states to quickstarts ("you should see X output").
3. Add a 10–15 minute onboarding spine linking install → quickstart → streaming → persistence.

## Priority 2 — Reduce adoption friction

1. Add a **Troubleshooting** section with top 10 setup/runtime errors and fixes.
2. Add a **Compatibility matrix** (Node/Next/provider package versions).
3. Add per-page version verification notes ("Last verified with Kortyx vX.Y.Z").

## Priority 3 — Support advanced users

1. Add deep **reference** pages for runtime hooks, stream protocol, and provider contracts.
2. Add production guides: retries, observability, failure handling, and security checklist.
3. Add migration docs for version-to-version upgrades and breaking changes.

## Suggested KPI targets

- Time-to-first-success ≤ 15 minutes.
- New-user quickstart completion rate ≥ 80%.
- Top recurring errors mapped to documented fixes ≥ 90%.
