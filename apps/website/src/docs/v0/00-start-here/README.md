# Start Here

Kortyx is an opinionated framework for teams building production AI features that need explicit behavior, predictable runtime flow, and strong control over providers, streaming, and state.

## Choose your path

- New project setup: [Installation](../01-getting-started/01-installation.md)
- First end-to-end flow: [Quickstart (Next.js)](../01-getting-started/02-quickstart-nextjs.md)
- Build mental model first: [Core Concepts](../02-core-concepts/01-define-workflows.md)
- Implement task-oriented features: [Guides](../03-guides/02-interrupts-and-resume.md)
- Harden for production: [Production](../04-production/01-persistence.md)
- Verify exact APIs and protocols: [Reference](../05-reference/01-package-overview.md)

## Stack direction

- Next.js: fastest path for an initial app integration.
- Express/Fastify: strong fit for server-heavy orchestration and infrastructure-owned deployments.
  - Start with [Process Chat](../03-guides/08-process-chat.md)
  - Then configure [Framework Adapters](../04-production/02-framework-adapters.md)

> **Good to know:** The docs are TypeScript-first and prioritize system-builder workflows with production reliability in mind.
