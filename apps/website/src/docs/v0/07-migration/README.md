# Migration & Versions

This section tracks upgrade guidance and behavior changes across versions.

## Current policy

- Within the same major version, docs are updated in place.
- New major versions should include dedicated upgrade notes and breaking-change guidance.

## What to check before upgrading

1. API changes across agent/runtime/hooks/providers packages.
2. Provider setup and model initialization expectations.
3. Streaming and interrupt/resume behavior in your app path.

- [Interrupts and Resume](../03-guides/02-interrupts-and-resume.md)

> **Good to know:** When your app is production-critical, validate upgrade changes in a staging workflow before rollout.
